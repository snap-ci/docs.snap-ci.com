Snap provides gradle version `<%= data.aurora_versions.gradle %>` on the `PATH`.

By default if Snap detects the presence of a `build.gradle` at your project root, it will execute
`gradle test assemble` in order to run your tests.

For the most part the defaults for Gradle and JVM options should work fine.

If required, you may tweak the arguments to suit your needs.

The complete list of arguments supported by sbt are listed here -
