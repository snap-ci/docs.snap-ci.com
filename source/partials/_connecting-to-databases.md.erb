# Connecting to relational databases

* **SQLite** - SQLite does not need any credentials to create or connect to the database
* **MySQL** - To connect to the database, we provide the environment variables `SNAP_DB_MYSQL_USER`, `SNAP_DB_MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `SNAP_DB_MYSQL_HOST`, `SNAP_DB_MYSQL_PORT`, `SNAP_DB_MYSQL_URL` and `SNAP_DB_MYSQL_JDBC_URL`
* **PostgreSQL** - To connect to the database, we provide the environment variables `SNAP_DB_PG_USER`, `SNAP_DB_PG_PASSWORD`, `SNAP_DB_PG_HOST`, `SNAP_DB_PG_PORT`, `SNAP_DB_PG_URL` and `SNAP_DB_PG_JDBC_URL`. We have common postgresql extensions such as `hstore` and `postgis` installed. They must be activated by calling [`CREATE EXTENSION`](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-createextension.html) in your database migration scripts.

In addition to the connection options specified above, Snap provides some more conveniences:

* For Ruby projects that use a database, Snap will automatically supply an alternate `config/database.yml` file which is configured to connect to the database you selected to run your build against.

# Connecting to non relational datastores

These services all run on localhost and default ports which are as follows:

* **CouchDB**: localhost:5984
* **MongoDB**: localhost:27017
* **Redis**:   localhost:6379

Common clients/libraries which use these, such as CouchRest, Mongoid or Resque should all "just work". For example, the default mongoid.yml set up by the gem would look something like this and would work out of the box.
