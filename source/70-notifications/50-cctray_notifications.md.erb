You may poll the status of one or all your projects by using the CCTray API, this API can be consumed by a lot of CI monitoring tools like [CCMenu](http://ccmenu.sourceforge.net)(OS X), [CCTray](http://ccnet.sourceforge.net/CCNET/CCTray.html)(Windows), [BuildNotify](https://bitbucket.org/Anay/buildnotify/wiki/Home)(GNU/Linux) and [BuildCheckerApp](https://github.com/willmendesneto/build-checker-app#readme) for cross platform support (OS X, Windows and GNU/Linux)


Snap provides CCTray feeds for individual projects and also for all projects on your dashboard. Personalized URLs for the feed are available on the project build history page and dashboard.

# Access Control

Anyone with the CCTray URL can view the updates to a project. It is recommended that you only share these URLs in a trusted environment.
