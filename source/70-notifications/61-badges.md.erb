Snap provides build status image/project badges which you can add to your GitHub page.

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/chat/badge_pass' %>
<%= retina_image 'screenshots/chat/badge_fail' %>

# Where I can get them?

* Navigate to the notifications configuration section from your project's build history page.

   <%= retina_image 'screenshots/chat/notification' %>

* You will be taken to the badge page which will have the list of urls of your build status and badges.

   <%= retina_image 'screenshots/chat/badges' %>

* Thats it! You have your Build status image and project badges. Copy the appropriate badge format and use it in your README file or website. In this project, we have a README.MD and hence using the Markdown format.

   <%= retina_image 'screenshots/chat/badge_example' %>
