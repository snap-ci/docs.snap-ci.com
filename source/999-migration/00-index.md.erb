We have provided two configuration export options to ease your migration to other tools:

* <%= topic_link 'Migration to GoCD', 'Migration to GoCD' %>
* <%= topic_link 'Migration to other CI and CD tools', 'Migration to other CI and CD tools' %>

If you want to continue using a staged pipeline built to support continuous delivery after Snap CI goes away we highly recommend [GoCD] (https://www.gocd.io/). 

If you are interested in cloud based CI tools there are many options out there and we suggest you start to trial them all immediately. If you would like our opinions on which CI/CD tool may best suit your needs please [get in touch with us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>). where we are happy to provide you with some personalized advice.
