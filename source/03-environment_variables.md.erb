Snap exports a number of environment variables during each build, which you may find useful during your build:

# Detect if your tests are running under CI

* ``SNAP_CI=true``
* ``CI=true``

# X-Server

* ``DISPLAY`` - the display variable in case your build performs any GUI testing (web browsers, for e.g.). Snap ensures that `xvfb` is already running with a resolution of `1280x1024x16`. If you're running GUI testing tools, you may want to checkout our guide on <%= topic_link "Testing with browsers", "browser testing" %>.
