Snap exports a number of environment variables during each build, which you may find useful during your build:

# Detect if your tests are running under CI

* ``SNAP_CI=true``
* ``CI=true``

# X-Server

* ``DISPLAY`` - the display variable in case your build performs any GUI testing (web browsers, for e.g.). Snap ensures that `xvfb` is already running with a resolution of `1280x1024x16`. If you're running GUI testing tools, you may want to checkout our guide on <%= topic_link "Testing with browsers", "browser testing" %>.

# Language and Locale settings

* ``LANG=en_US.UTF-8``
* ``LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8``

# Current build details

* ``SNAP_BRANCH`` - the name of the git branch
* ``SNAP_COMMIT`` - the git commit SHA
* ``SNAP_COMMIT_SHORT`` - the short git commit SHA
* ``SNAP_PIPELINE_COUNTER`` - the counter of the currently running pipeline
* ``SNAP_STAGE_NAME`` - the name of the currently running stage
* ``TRACKING_PIPELINE`` - has the value 'true' if the build is running on the tracking pipeline
