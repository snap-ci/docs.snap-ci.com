# Download an artifact

Redirects to a location containing an artifact. The redirect may not be cached and must be consumed within a few seconds.

`GET /project/:owner/:repository/branch/:branch_name/artifacts/{tracking-pipeline,integration-pipeline}/:pipeline_counter/:stage_name/:job_counter/:artifact_name`{:.api-method-url}

For Pull request:

`GET /project/:owner/:repository/pull/:pull_counter/artifacts/defaultPipeline/:pipeline_counter/:stage_name/:job_counter/:artifact_name`{:.api-method-url}

<%= render_api_example 'artifacts/get-an-artifact',
      method: :get,
      url:    'https://api.snap-ci.com/project/snap-ci/api-docs-sample-repository/branch/master/artifacts/tracking-pipeline/25/Build/1/foo'
%>

If you wish to download the artifact using curl you can use the `--location` argument that allows following of redirects and will hence download the artifact.
